// Carries settings across the rename from Lead to Mx.
//
// Every preference this tweak owns used to be stored under a "Lead"-prefixed
// key in NSUserDefaults; they are now "Mx"-prefixed. Without this, an upgrade
// would look to the user like a factory reset: every toggle back off, the edit
// history gone, the ghost exception list empty, the chosen language back to
// English.
//
// The copy is by prefix rather than by a list of names, so a key added later
// migrates on its own — and so does the persisted data, which is where the real
// loss would be (MxEditHistory, MxEditHistoryPeers, MxDeletedMsgIds,
// MxGhostExceptions).
//
// Runs as a constructor, before any code reads a default. Constructor priority
// 101 is the lowest an application may use; anything else that reads
// NSUserDefaults from its own constructor therefore sees migrated values.
//
// Keys not owned by this tweak — disableOnlineStatus and its siblings — never
// carried the prefix and are read under their original names, so they need
// nothing here.
